            <p>Roles</p>

                , Researcher</p>

            <h3>Target Audience</h3>
            <p>An app for busy gallery managers which streamlines the art auction process.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Constraints & Challenges</h3>
            <p>The main challenge was including a full range of gallery managment functions in a simplified app.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Research Study Details</h3>
            <p>User research revealed 2 main pain points in running an art auction:</p>
            <div class="project-grid">
                <ol>
                    <li>Complicated:<br><br>Most auction software has a steep learning curve, requiring extra training
                        for
                        new hires. Having an intuitive design is key to saving users time and energy on onboarding.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Repetitive:<br><br>Having multiple platforms for inventory, auctions and reporting leads to
                        repetitive data entry at each stage of a pieces’ life in the gallery. Having inventory
                        management, auction, and reporting features built into the app reduce redundant data entry.</li>
                </ol>

            <h3>user testing results</h3>
            <p>We performed two rounds of remote, supervised usability testing, which garnered the following findings:
            </p>
            <br>
            <div class="project-grid">
                <div>
                    <h3>Round 1 findings</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Users wanted the freedom to select a date or time independent of each other in the
                            scheduling
                            process.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>Users wanted to see what the “view pieces” and plus buttons did on the add pieces screen.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h3>Round 2 findings</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Users thought that the local navigation buttons at the top of the screens were too large.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </div>

            <br>
            <h3>High-Fidelity Designs</h3>
            <p>Our usability studies provided us with the design direction needed to bring the design into a final
                high-fidelity design.
                <br>
                <div class="project-grid">
                    <div>
                        <img src="./images/auction/mock1.png" alt="">
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <img src="./images/auction/mock2.png" alt="">
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <img src="./images/auction/mock3.png" alt="">
                    </div>
                </div>
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Conclusion & Next Steps</h3>
            <p>1. Build on what went well in this user flow to create user flows for the inventory and reporting flows.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>2. Conduct another round of testing to further refine the main user flow.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>3. Add user profile and setting functionality.
